   A case study on community wireless networks - experiences from the
                                trenches
                    draft-community-wireless-nets-00

Abstract

   Roughly ten years ago, a huge number of so called community wireless
   networks appeared worldwide, often employing mesh routing based on
   cheap off the shelf Wi-Fi equipment and often enough covering whole
   cities.  These community wireless networks had notable successes in
   deploying results from the IETF MANET working group (for example OLSR
   RFC3626 XXX fix reference properly XXX).  In addition, there have
   been some interesting lessons learned from deploying these large
   MANETs.  This document discusses the structures and findings of the
   community networks.

4.  Motivation for this draft

   "here is the stuff where your results are actually used" -> MANET WG
   and academic community for gaia: how to build these networks

5.  Definitions

   o  what is a CWN?  Comparison to MANETs.  Not every CWN is a MANET.
      But where MANETs make sense in CWNs.

6.  Why CWNs?

   on a high level... * because we can * because it's fun: technical
   experiment * because it helps with disaster recovery * because it can
   help in suppressed internet situations * because they complement
   existing cable based networks: cheap to build, filling up the white
   spots on the broadband landscape

7.  History / Genesis

   o  consume.net, 2003 Freifunk, Funkfeuer, Paris Sans Fils, Seattle
      Wireless, etc.

8.  Current situation / overview and description of existing CWNs

   o  how do they work?

   o  which exist?

   o  sizes and how to measure

   o  differences between CWNs

   o  categorisations

   o  interactions (wireless summit, battlemesh)

9.  A case study: details on FF

   o  social aspects

   o  legal aspects

   o  special discussion on things relating to MANET WG

   o  metrics

   o  management of nodes

10.  case study 2: details on XYZ / Freifunk / ...

11.  Lessons learned

   users of CWNs are describing their lessons learned * special
   discussion on things relating to GAIA/MANET WG * metrics * security -
   how to deal with routing security issues in CWNs? * legal framework
   lacks/challenges

12.  Reality check on current research topics: what is still needed?
     Where to concentrate on?

   (This is already an interpretation of the results of the previous
   chapters) * what did we not yet manage to solve?  What are the most
   stringent needs right now? * for example: * automatic channel
   assignment - distributed agreement protocol * multi-topology *
   multipath routing which is channel aware * metrics * CSN * routing
   security - detection is important!

13.  Bib

   ... (generated)...

14.  Meta

14.1.  Stuff needed

   github repo: * README.markdown * TIMELINE.md * HOWTO-contribute.md

   "evangelism": * contact co-contributors * why should they contribute?
   * what can the MANET WG learn?  GAIA?

   howto work on github?: * send us pull requests! * initial master
