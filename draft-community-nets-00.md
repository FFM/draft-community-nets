# Title: a case study on community wireless networks
# Authors: Aaron Kaplan, Emmanuel Baccelli, ... Henning? CONFINE people?



# TOC

## Intro

## Disclaimer?
We are not claiming to be exhaustive for all CWNs
You are welcome to contribute... here is the gihub page and send us pull requests

## Motivation for this draft
 "here is the stuff where your results are actually used" -> MANET WG and academic community
 for gaia: how to build these networks

## Definitions
  * what is a CWN? Comparison to MANETs. Not every CWN is a MANET. But where MANETs make sense in CWNs.

## Why CWNs?
  on a high level...
  * because we can
  * because it's fun: technical experiment
  * because it helps with disaster recovery
  * because it can help in suppressed internet situations
  * because they complement existing cable based networks: cheap to build, filling up the white spots on the broadband landscape


## History / Genesis
  * consume.net, 2003 Freifunk, Funkfeuer, Paris Sans Fils, Seattle Wireless, etc.

## Current situation / overview and description of existing CWNs
  * how do they work?
  * which exist?
  * sizes and how to measure
  * differences between CWNs
  * categorisations
  * interactions (wireless summit, battlemesh)

## A case study: details on FF
  * social aspects
  * legal aspects
  * special discussion on things relating to MANET WG
  * metrics
  * management of nodes

## case study 2: details on XYZ / Freifunk / ...

## Lessons learned
  users of CWNs are describing their lessons learned
  * special discussion on things relating to GAIA/MANET WG
  * metrics
  * security - how to deal with routing security issues in CWNs?
  * legal framework lacks/challenges


## Reality check on current research topics: what is still needed? Where to concentrate on?
(This is already an interpretation of the results of the previous chapters)
  * what did we not yet manage to solve? What are the most stringent needs right now?
  * for example:
  * automatic channel assignment - distributed agreement protocol
  * multi-topology
  * multipath routing which is channel aware
  * metrics
  * CSN
  * routing security - detection is important!
